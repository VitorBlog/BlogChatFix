**BlogChatFix** is a tiny Fabric client mod that fixes the annoying Linux chat bug ([MC-122477](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-122477)) where opening chat sometimes types `'t'` (or another key if rebound). It seems to happen only on Linux/GNU.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

The fix works by adding a small delay before allowing typing in chat. This prevents the first character from being accidentally typed when the chat opens.

## To-Do üìù

* Implement support to 1.13 <-> 1.18
* Make Mojang fix this
